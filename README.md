Weâ€™re making a short story horror game about three friends. One of the friends has been murdered, and you, as the player, have completely lost their memory and must find out how your friend was killed using clues around the map. Throughout the game, the user will complete puzzles in order to obtain clues and items to aid them in their investigation. The player must also evade an enemy by confronting them using weapons found on the map. Each member of our group has a big interest in games ranging from various types of genres and play styles, and we find scary/horror games particularly engaging and exciting. We chose to create a short story based scary game because there is a lot of room to create a suspenseful narrative and allows us to experiment with storytelling, music, design, and the complexity of the game mechanics.This is a short horror video game for CS 3354 Software Development, Group 6. This project was made to learn about how software is developed in industry. Made using Godot 4.3
